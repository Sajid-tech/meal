    <!-- The following is an array of 10 students ages:
    => const ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]
    - Sort the array and find the min and max age
    - Find the median age(one middle item or two middle items divided by two)
    - Find the average age(all items divided by number of items)
    - Find the range of the ages(max minus min)
    - Compare the value of (min - average) and (max - average), use abs() method -->
